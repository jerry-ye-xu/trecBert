       "    'brief_summary': 'Women with BRCA germline mutations face a very high risk of developing breast cancer during their lives. It was shown that for carrier patients, breast conservation, comprising of lumpectomy followed by whole breast radiation, was not associated with increased risk of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence as compared with non carriers (10-15% over 10 years), especially if they also underwent prophylactic oophorectomy. Yet their risk of subsequent contralateral breast cancer was significantly increased, reported as high as 25-30% over 10 years and 40% over 15 years, as compared to 3% and 7% respectively in non carriers. The reduction in ipsilateral disease was attributed to radiation of the affected breast. We propose that for breast cancer patients with BRCA germline mutation that choose to have breast-conserving therapy and refuse prophylactic contralateral mastectomy, prophylactic radiation to the contralateral breast may reduce the rate of subsequent contralateral breast cancer and offer an option for risk reduction.',\n",

Treatment: Chemotherapy, Hormonal therapy and XRT to the affected breast as per treating institution. Radiation therapy: Patients will undergo a pre-treatment planning CT with 5mm cuts in the treatment position, on a breast board, with both arms extended above their head. The organs at risk (heart, lungs) will be contoured on the CT scan. The affected breast (with the index lesion) and associated lymphatic drainage will be treated according to the treating physician decision. The contralateral breast will be treated with 2 tangent fields, using 1.8-2 Gy/fx to a total dose of 50-50.4 Gy.

       "    'detailed_description': 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the U.S. - about 1 in 8 women will develop the disease in their lifetime. Although tremendous strides have been made in its treatment, more than 40,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease in 2005 alone. These sobering and well-recognized risks are a major source of distress among women free from the disease, and among those who have completed treatment for new onset disease. Regarding the latter, clinical interventions are virtually absent during the highly stressful transitional period in coming off treatment to becoming a breast cancer survivor, and no studies have tested interventions to reduce distress, particularly fear of recurrence, and improve quality of life during this time. Therefore, we proposed to conduct a two-armed randomized wait-list controlled study on use of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention among 100 female breast cancer patients (stages 0-III) who have recently completed treatment with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Specifically, we investigated: (i) whether MBSR favorably influences psychological status, quality of life, stress hormones, and immune status; and (ii) possible mechanisms by which MBSR may work, in particular, through a reduction in fear of breast cancer recurrence. Both objectives were studied at the critical transition time following completion of surgical and adjuvant therapies (end of treatment to 18 months thereafter) for breast cancer. The MBSR intervention included 6 weeks of class sessions according to the curriculum established by Kabat Zinn and Santorelli. Analysis of covariance models are being used to assess whether change in the above-defined outcomes varies by random assignment (MBSR or wait-list), per the intention-to-treat principle. Moreover, change (reduction) in fear of recurrence attributed to MBSR is being investigated as a mediator. If this R21 exploratory study shows that MBSR improves patient proximal outcomes following completion of breast cancer treatment, the science will be mature enough for future large-scale evaluation of MBSR as a potential therapy to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality in breast cancer patient populations.',\n",

Secondary - Compare the effect of these interventions on breast self-examination, clinical breast exam, risk perceptions, and breast cancer worry. - Compare the mechanism of action of these interventions on participants by assessing the impact of covariants (coping mechanisms, expanded Health Belief Model variables, breast cancer worry, breast cancer risk factors including family history, risk perceptions, discussion of breast cancer with relatives, previous screening practices, intentions to screen, and various demographic variables—age, race, and education) on breast cancer screening. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are approached to complete a baseline survey while they are waiting for their clinic visits. Baseline surveys measure breast cancer risk factors, current breast cancer screening practices, intentions to screen, risk perceptions, breast cancer worry, coping mechanisms, and discussion of breast cancer with relatives. After completion of the baseline surveys, participants are then randomized to 1 of 2 education arms. - Arm I (intervention group): Participants undergo a computerized risk assessment followed by personalized risk-tailored health messages. Health messages are based on principles of the expanded Health Belief Model (HBM). These messages include screening and lifestyle recommendations, information on the seriousness of breast cancer, instructions on how to arrange a mammography appointment, and contact information for genetic and psychosocial counseling. - Arm II (control group): Participants receive generalized breast health information sheets that contain appropriate screening and lifestyle recommendations for the general public and contact information for genetic and psychosocial counseling. All participants undergo follow-up assessment by telephone (or by mail if unreachable by phone) at 1, 6, and 18 months after the initial intervention. Self-reported mammography use, additional breast health monitoring practices, risk perception, breast cancer worry, coping mechanisms, HBM-related beliefs, and family communication are measured.

       "    'detailed_description': 'The long term goal of this trial is to determine if intervention in subjects with extensive mammographic densities (a risk factor for breast cancer) with a low fat-high carbohydrate diet will reduce the incidence of breast cancer by 37%. We propose to meet this goal by carrying out a randomized multi-centre trial of dietary intervention in subjects at increased risk of breast cancer that is now in progress. The method used is to recruit subjects with extensive mammographic densities and enrol them in a randomized trial in which they receive one of two kinds of dietary counselling. A control group receives general advice about nutrition but is not counselled to change their intake of dietary fat or carbohydrate, and an intervention group is given intensive counselling to reduce their intake of total fat to a target of 15% of calories and increase intake of carbohydrate to maintain intake of total calories. Recruitment to this trial has been in progress in Toronto, Hamilton, London and Windsor since 1991, and in Vancouver since 1994, and all of the 4,615 subjects required for the trial were recruited by November 1998. The trial is explanatory in that it seeks to determine if there is a biological effect of dietary fat reduction in terms of a reduction in breast cancer incidence. To meet this goal we will select as participants highly motivated subjects who are at increased risk of breast cancer, provide them with a high level of assistance in making a dietary alteration, follow them carefully to ensure the correct identification of subjects who develop breast cancer, and analyse the results both according to intention to treat and dietary compliance. This trial does not attempt to assess directly the possible effects of dietary counselling on the health of the general public. II Specific Aims 1. To recruit 4,615 Canadian women with extensive mammographic density and to enrol them in a randomized trial of dietary fat reduction and follow up until 2006. 2. To compare in the control and intervention groups of this trial the incidence of breast cancers, as well as other histological changes in the breast tissue of patients undergoing surgical biopsy of the breast. 3. To determine if a reduction in dietary fat intake will reduce either the proportion of the breast area occupied by radiological signs of density or the total quantity of density.',\n",

       "    'detailed_description': \"Decisions about breast cancer are complex and preference-based. Existing decision aids that help identify women eligible for tamoxifen based on their breast cancer risk, such as the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), were not designed to identify women's risks for side-effects, her preferences for outcomes affected by treatment, nor the net balance of benefits and risks. It is possible to predict the risks of side effects of treatments according to patient characteristics, using patient-specific models.Our goal is to develop a decision aid, TXplore, that rates the overall benefit:risk profiles of various breast cancer prevention strategies according to a woman's risks for breast cancer, side-effects, and preferences. Each user will receive a customized report card grading each available prevention option, using preference-weighted risk:benefit grades; users can also explore personalized feedback from the program. Our hypotheses are that this tool can improve the implementation of appropriate prevention strategies, promote risk reduction behavior, and improve PCP's ability to identify and counsel high risk women.We propose building on modeling techniques that link the benefits and risks of preventive strategies to patient characteristics and preferences. We now seek to conduct focus groups and usability tests on end-users to optimize the design of the prototype TXplore. The Specific Aims are: 1. To optimize the design of TXplore by focus groups conducted among diverse high-risk women and PCPs to a) identify the domains driving decisions about prevention and explore the framing of questions comparing the relative importance of one domain to another, synthesizing this information as preference trade-off questions; and b) explore the framing of risk:benefit grades and personalized feedback. 2. To assess the comprehensibility of preference trade-off questions by testing each question on a diverse sample of 50 high-risk women, revising and retesting. 3. To assess the usability of TXplore for patients and PCPsThe successful completion of this project will produce a novel tool for counseling women about their individual benefits and risks of breast cancer prevention strategies. It will be the first tool of its kind to integrate individual patient risks and preferences into decision support.\",\n",
