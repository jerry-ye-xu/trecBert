To date, there are no methods to reliably select which patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that benefit most from treatment with bevacizumab. Data have shown that high levels of plasma VEGF are prognostic and correlates with a worse disease outcome in some tumour types, including advanced NSCLC. Recent data are suggestive of a predictive value of imaging techniques for early detection of antiangiogenic treatment efficacy in different cancers. To our knowledge there are no presented data available on correlation between changes in diffusion-weighted MR and response to bevacizumab treatment in lung cancer. The current study is designed as a pilot study to prospectively investigate changes in MR variables during treatment with bevacizumab and to detect signals of prognostic and/or predictive value of MR changes during treatment.',\n",

       " 'Neo-adjuvant Treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving cetuximab together with cisplatin and docetaxel before radiation therapy and cetuximab followed by surgery and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer that can be removed by surgery.',\n",

It is not well understood whether there are hereditary risk factors that influence the risk of lung cancer. It has been recently found that a small number of families have an inherited (passed from parent to child) change in one of their genes that may contribute to an increased tendency to develop lung cancers, even in never smokers. In some lung cancer patients this gene, called \"EGFR\", contains a DNA change known as an \"inherited EGFR mutation\". Early data indicate that these inherited EGFR mutations may be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. So far, only a small number of families have been found to carry inherited EGFR mutations. For this reason the risk of lung cancer associated with inherited EGFR mutations is not well understood. Understanding the risk may help investigators find ways of detecting lung cancer sooner or reducing the risk of developing lung cancer. It was recently discovered that lung cancer patients who are found to carry one rare EGFR mutation in their cancer cells, called \"T790M\", have an increased risk of carrying an inherited EGFR mutation in their normal cells as well. This represents a new strategy for finding individuals and families carrying inherited EGFR mutations. This research study is designed to find cancer patients whose tumors have this EGFR mutation, T790M, to find out if they also have an inherited EGFR mutation.

       " \"Impact of iMRI on the Extent of Resection in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastomas Standard treatment of glioblastomas (GBMs) consists of microsurgical resection followed by concomitant chemoradiation. The extent of resection is one of the most important prognostic factors with significant influence on the survival of patients. State of the art technique to achieve the most radical resection possible in conventional surgery is fluorescence-guidance with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). If available, intraoperative MRI (iMRI)-guided tumor resection enables an intraoperative resection control and subsequent continuation of surgery if contrast enhancing tumor remnants are found. Therefore a more radical resection and longer survival of patients might be possible. To date no comparison of these two leading technologies for GBM-surgery is available to identify the best surgical therapy of this fatal disease and to justify significant healthcare-economic differences between both technologies. Goal of this study is to assess the value of iMRI guidance in the resection of GBMs in comparison to conventional 5-ALA microsurgery. Primary endpoint is the number of total resections (no residual contrast enhancement) in the postoperative MRI (T1+CM within 48 hours after surgery) in each group. Secondary endpoints are perioperative clinical data, progression free survival, patients' clinical condition and overall survival. The study design was chosen to be a parallel-group approach to compare iMRI and 5-ALA centers (n=13) to exclude possible bias which might be found by randomizing patients within individual iMRI centers and to have surgeons with the most experience possible in use of each respective technology.\",\n",

       " \"Cryotherapy With in Situ Immunotherapy in Melanoma Metastasis Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and its incidence has doubled every 20 years in France, where this cancer is responsible of more than 1600 deaths each year. Patients with early diagnosis have good prognosis and can be generally cured by surgery only. Advanced melanoma however has a very bad prognosis. Loco-regional lymph nodes are usually the first distant localization in metastatic melanoma. Lymph node dissection is then the recommended treatment, although it's impact on survival has never been proven. In the same way, the benefit risk profile of interferon as adjuvant treatment after lymph node dissection is still much debated. Recently, new treatments either with immunotherapy (ipilimumab, nivolumab) or by the targeted therapy dabrafenib/trametinib in patients with BRAF mutation have shown an impact on survival in the adjuvant setting after lymph node dissection. But, it has not yet been established if this strategy has a benefit gain compared to starting those treatments only in the metastatic setting after watchful follow-up. Moreover, if these novel therapies (targeted therapies: TT, immunotherapies : IT) demonstrated for the first time a real benefit in terms of survival or of responses rates in melanoma, physicians and patients had to address new problems, such as the management of unusual adverse events. Partial and dissociated responses can also be seen with those new treatments. Some patients will have complete response in some lesions, stabilization in others and progression in a few. It is to be expected that one of the real key points of this therapy is to be found here, as this situation is commonly seen, and it would probably be a poor choice to stop a treatment that is globally effective for progression of only 1 or 2 lesions, in a patient otherwise stabilized. That is the context in which interventional radiology (IR) should be considered as an extremely efficient option. IR is a real medical revolution in the last 2 decades.

Combine immunotherapy with tumoral necrosis, which inherently increases the effects of immunotherapy by massive tumoral leakage of danger signals and tumoral antigens; 2.

       " 'Kidney Disease Biomarkers Kidney Disease Biomarkers Summary: This study will identify biomarkers (proteins and other molecules in the blood or urine) that may help scientists predict what kidney disease a patient has and whether a given patient would respond to particular therapies. The study will look for biomarkers in the blood and urine of patients with various kidney diseases and study of the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on biomarkers. Blood and urine from healthy volunteers will be studied for comparison. Healthy people and the following patients may be eligible for this study: adults with diabetic nephropathy 18 years of age and older; children with newly diagnosed clinical idiopathic nephrotic syndrome between 2 and 18 year of age; children and adults with glomerular disease (minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or collapsing glomerulopathy). Participants undergo tests and procedures as follows: Glomerular Disease: Adults with glomerular disease provide about four to six blood and urine samples over the course of 6 to 12 months. The samples are collected at the time of regularly scheduled visits for the NIH treatment protocol in which they are participating. Children provide only blood samples. Chronic Kidney Disease: Patients with chronic kidney disease provide a blood and urine sample every 6 months for 3 years or more. Angiotensin Antagonism: Patients with chronic kidney disease who are taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs stop their medicines for 4 weeks, while those who are not taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs begin one of the medicines. In general, patients just starting on the medications continue them after the study is completed, since they are beneficial for chronic kidney disease. - Medication withdrawal group: Patients come to NIH for 2 successive days at the beginning of the study for blood and urine tests (including one 24-hour urine collection) and to receive iothalamate (a chemical used to measure kidney function). Iothalamate is delivered over 24 hours through a needle placed in the abdomen (or elsewhere) via a pump similar to pumps that some diabetics use to deliver insulin. Patients then stop taking their ACE inhibitor or ARB medication. They monitor their blood pressure every day and return to NIH after 1, 2 and 4 weeks for blood tests. During week 4, the iothalamate infusion is repeated, and blood and urine samples are collected as at the beginning of the study. Patients then resume taking their ACE inhibitor or ARB once a day with the dose being increased at 2-week intervals. They come to NIH weekly after 1 week and then every other week for blood tests. Four weeks after reaching the highest FDA-recommended dose of medication tolerated, the iothalamate infusion and blood and urine collections are repeated. - Medication induction group: At the beginning of the study, patients have the iothalamate infusion and blood and urine collections described above and then begin to take either an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The dose is increased after 2 weeks. Patients monitor their blood pressure every day. After being on the highest dose for 4 weeks, patients repeat the iothalamate infusion and blood and urine collections. The study is then complete and they are provided a 2-month supply of medicine to take home. Information is gathered on symptoms, treatments, and results of past laboratory tests of all patients. Healthy volunteers provide blood and urine sample collections every month or every other month for up to four collections to be used for biomarker studies and the screen for common chronic diseases. ...',\n",

       " 'Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for Palliation of Cholangiocarcinoma Successful palliation of biliary obstruction is the main goal for reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with biliary disease and biliary obstruction related to cholangiocarcinoma. Surgical intervention for the sale is unfortunately complicated by a 30-day postoperative mortality rate of between 7 and 24%. Moreover, because of recovery time the quality of life following surgery is only improved in a minority. At present endoscopic insertion of a plastic or metal stent is the method of choice to relieve obstructive jaundice without the high morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. But this relief is unfortunately temporary since stents tend to become obstructed and the fact that effective biliary drainage in the proximal lesion is challenging. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a new therapeutic approach that specifically targets neoplastic cells. This therapy involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent followed by activation of the agent by illumination with non-thermal light of a specific wavelength, resulting in cell death from direct cytotoxicity and ischemic necrosis. A randomized controlled trial study by Ortner et all confirmed the significant advantage of PDT with regard to relief of jaundice, quality of life, and survival. In photodynamic therapy (PDT) the uniform distribution of externally applied light is desirable but often difficult to achieve. An optical fiber tip producing cylindrical or lateral light emission can facilitate the application of laser energy by direct implantation of the tip into solid tumors. However, currently used FDA approved glass diffusers used in standard of care PDT might break in the bile ducts causing injury since they are not meant to be used within bile ducts through an endoscope or choledochoscope. Hence, there is a need to evaluate and introduce more efficient and safe non-glass cylindrical optic fiber diffuser for photo dynamic therapy in the bile ducts. Recent studies have shown that the Pioneer plastic optic diffuser is safe and effective in photodynamic therapy, it can be also used via a choledochoscope. We aim to add to the clinical evidence by conducting an open label observational study trial using this fiber optic diffuser during photo dynamic therapy in the bile ducts.',\n",

A dose-response effect has been demonstrated by de Hert et al, with greatest reductions of Troponin when Sevoflurane was used during the entire operation, as compared to Sevoflurane during parts of the operation. Sevoflurane, as other inhaled anesthetic agents, is sedative in low doses. Postoperative sedation after CABG is currently achieved with intravenous propofol. A new simplified method of administration of isoflurane or sevoflurane has been developed and tested by members of the research group. The Anesthetic Conserving Device is a modified heat-moisture exchanger (HME) that permits direct infusion of sevoflurane to the airway, where it is vaporized in an evaporator rod in the device. The primary aim (and primary hypothesis)of the current trial is to examine if postoperative sedation with sevoflurane after CABG is associated with improved cardiac outcome, measured as reduced levels of Troponin, BNP and reduced incidence of cardiac events, such as atrial fibrillation, need for inotropic drugs and myocardial infarction, compared with conventional propofol sedation. Other end-points of the trial are potential renal (protective) effects measured with cystatin C levels, need for dialysis but also measurements of inorganic fluorides in serum, as well as environmental aspects of sevoflurane sedation in a Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit. Furthermore, potential differences in ICU memories and well-being during stay in the intensive Care Unit will be investigated via patient questionnaires.

       " \"Study of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a condition characterized by a decreased attention span, hyperactivity, and/or impulsiveness inappropriate for a certain age. Typically, young children have what are known as subtle neurological signs. These are involuntary movements of one part of the body that occur while the child is making a voluntary movement of another part of the body. This is referred to as synkinesis, or overflow movements. These overflow movements disappear during normal development and are usually gone by the age of 10. However, in children with ADHD these overflow movements tend to be more intense and last long after the age of 10. This leads researchers to believe there is an abnormality in the maturation and development of the brain areas associated with motor activity in children with ADHD. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that gives information about brain function. It is very useful when studying areas of the nervous system related to motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum). A magnetic signal given from a special instrument held close to the patient's head stimulates a small area of the brain that controls a few muscles (for example, the muscles that control one finger). Doctors put electrodes (small pieces of metal taped to areas of the body) over the muscle to measure the electrical activity the muscle produces when it makes a movement. When the magnetic signal activates those muscles the electrodes pick up and record the electrical activity of the movement that the muscles make in response to the magnetic signal.

       " 'Identification of a New Gene Involved in Hereditary Lipodystrophy Human lipodystrophies (lipoD) represent a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by generalized or partial fat loss, with fat hypertrophy in other depots when partial.3, 4 Insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and diabetes are generally associated, leading to early complications. Acquired lipoD can be generalized, resembling congenital forms, or partial, as the Barraquer-Simons syndrome, with loss of fat in the upper part of the body contrasting with accumulation in the lower part. The most common forms of lipoD are iatrogenic. In human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, some first-generation antiretroviral drugs were strongly related with peripheral lipoatrophy and metabolic alterations. Genetic forms are very uncommon: recessive generalized congenital lipoD result in most cases from mutations in the genes encoding seipin or the 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2). Dominant partial familial lipoD result from mutations in genes encoding the nuclear protein lamin A/C or the adipose transcription factor PPARgamma. Importantly, LMNA mutations are also responsible for metabolic laminopathies, resembling the metabolic syndrome and progeria, a syndrome of premature aging. Molecular genetic bases of many rare forms of genetic lipoD remain to be elucidated.',\n",

The results of the test are used by the doctor to recommend therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) that the patient will receive before having surgery to remove the adenocarcinoma. When the patient goes to surgery, the adenocarcinoma that is removed is tested again. The results of that test are used to guide the choice of therapy after surgery.

       " 'The Functional and Clinicopathological Roles and Therapeutic Implication of Connective Tissue Growth Factor in Peritoneal Metastasis of Gastric Cancer For the past 50 years, gastric cancer has been one of the ten most frequent cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. In Taiwan, it is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for 6.3% of all cancer deaths. The poor prognosis of gastric cancer is mostly caused by the extensive metastasis to the lymph nodes, liver, and peritoneal dissemination even if curative resection was performed. The main cause of recurrence after curative or noncurative resection of advanced tumors is peritoneal metastasis because of possible direct spillage and dissemination of tumor cells as a result of surgical manipulation, and it is associated with a poor prognosis. As yet, no effective treatment has been developed for this condition. The development of peritoneal metastasis is a multistep process, beginning with attachment to peritoneal mesothelial cells, retraction of the mesothelial cells and exposure of the basement membrane, attachment to the basement membrane, degradation in the extracellular matrix, proliferation by the cancer cells, and angiogenesis, and it is clear that many types of agents are involved at the various stages of this process. Developing a new therapeutic method for this mode of metastasis is very important for improvement of gastric cancer treatment. CTGF is a secretory protein belonging to the CCN family (one among the three originally discovered members: cysteine-rich61, CTGF, and nephroblastoma-overexpressed gene). It is a multifunctional growth factor involved in wound healing, inflammation, cell adhesion, chemotaxis, apoptosis, tumor growth, and fibrosis. Recent studies showed that overexpression of CTGF in human oral squamous cell carcinoma reduces cell growth and tumorigenecity. Similar tumor growth inhibitory effects were observed in lung cancer cells in which CTGF overexpression was less angiogenic and metastatic due to blocking of the VEGF A signaling pathway. CTGF was also reported to be a key regulator of colorectal cancer invasion and metastasis, and it appears to be a better prognostic factor. These studies suggest that CTGF may involve the processes of peritoneal metastasis which includes cancer cell adhesion in peritoneum, proliferation and angiogenesis. Peritoneal mesothelium is the first surface encountered by disseminated tumor cells and successful adhesion is, therefore, of paramount importance in metastasis formation. Therefore, we hypothesized that CTGF is a potential molecule target, which may be related to cell adhesion to peritoneum, the first step of peritoneal metastasis, and its exact mechanism may includes proliferation and angiogenesis. In order to answer these important questions, first, we have performed the preliminary studies to prove CTGF did express in different gastric cancer cell lines including AGS, N87, TSGH, and MKN-45 by using RT-PCR and Western blotting, and gastric cancer tissues by using immunohistochemical method. Second, we demonstrated different levels of CTGF expression in different cell lines pose different adhesion ability in in-vitro adhesion assay. Third, we conducted a transient CTGF-overexpressed MKN45 gastric cancer cell line, and CTGF-overexpressed cell line had lower adhesive ability compared to the control. Next step in this project, we will be studying the roles of CTGF plays in cellular and molecular biology in vitro and in vivo and clinical significance associated with therapeutic potential of peritoneal metastasis from gastric cancer. We will generate stable clones of MKN45 cells harboring CTGF and its control cell line to elucidate the roles of CTGF in cancer cell adhesion, proliferation and angiogenesis in peritoneum.',\n",

This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the intervention to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma. The purpose of this study (Cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participants tumor. It is known that glioblastomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient\\'s tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body\\'s own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the glioblastoma to come back in the future. Two additional cohorts (1a and 1b) will be included in the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1).

       " 'Treatment Optimization of Cetuximab in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Based on Tumor Uptake of 89Zr-labeled Cetuximab Assessed by PET 3rd line standard treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) harboring K-ras wild type consists of anti-EGFR treatment with either cetuximab or panitumumab. This type of treatment has a modest but significant beneficial activity in this patient group with improved progression-free and overall survival. Although it is well known that patients with advanced CRC harboring a K-Ras mutation will not respond to anti-EGFR treatment, it is not understood why patients with K-Ras wild type CRC do not all benefit from this type of therapy. In order to optimize treatment of these patients as well as health care costs, it is extremely important to identify those patients who will respond to treatment with an EGFR inhibitor at an early stage. The investigators hypothesize that the differences in response to treatment with cetuximab are due to variability in the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of the antibody. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that patients who do not respond to anti-EGFR treatment, have insufficient drug levels in tumor tissue. The investigators hypothesize that this is due to pharmacodynamic processes such as sequestration of cetuximab in the liver which expresses high levels of EGF receptor. With the introduction of immuno-positron emission tomography (PET), an attractive novel option to visualize molecular interactions has been developed using the combination of PET with labeled mAbs. Cetuximab labeled with zirconium-89 (89Zr) has been successfully generated (GMP) and is available for this study. Previous studies have shown excellent stability of this compound and 89Zr is shown to be safe in humans. The investigators will use 89Zr-cetuximab to demonstrate tumor targeting by imaging and explore the relation of uptake with treatment response. With this approach the investigators hope to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of this therapeutic mAb in metastasized CRC and eventually develop strategies that may improve efficacy of cetuximab treatment.',\n",

The main purpose of this study is to study how safe and suitable treatment with Afatinib is in participants before surgery to remove the tumor. Another goal of the study is to see if treatment with Afatinib affects the growth and activity of the tumor. Afatinib has not been approved for use by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and is experimental. In some persons, the growth of cancer cells is thought to be stimulated by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). This is a protein found in the body which binds to the cell wall to sites called receptors and stimulates cell growth. Some cells have too many receptors and uncontrolled growth and because of this, develop into a cancer tumor. There are several other cancer drugs that bind to these receptors to slow or stop cancer growth such as Gefitinib and erlotinib which are FDA approved and used for the treatment of NSCLC. The drug Afatinib has been shown to inhibit mutated EGF receptors in clinical trials and may be a candidate for the treatment of NSCLC and a variety of early stage cancers. Participants in this study will take Afatinib by mouth, in pill form, for at least 14 days before having their scheduled surgery to remove their cancer tumor.

Depending on the results, this study may raise or alleviate concern that vascular surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm could contribute to early perioperative exacerbation of pre-existing eye disease and increase a patient's vulnerability to developing a type of blindness known as ischemic optic neuropathy. The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate whether intraocular pressure measurements with a handheld tonometer will detect changes in intraocular pressure related to intraoperative events during aortic cross clamping and unclamping that may provide information on causes of perioperative blindness.\",\n",

The SNA consists of nucleic acids arranged on the surface of a small spherical gold nanoparticle. This is a first-in-human trial to determine the safety of NU-0129. NU-0129 can cross the blood brain barrier (a filtering mechanism that carry blood to the brain). Once within the tumor, the nucleic acid component is able to target a gene called Bcl2L12 that is present in glioblastoma multiforme, and is associated with tumor growth. This gene prevents tumor cells from apoptosis, which is the process of programmed cell death, thus promoting tumor growth. Researchers think that targeting the Bcl2L12 gene with NU-0129 will help stop cancer cells from growing.',\n",

Carnitine is very important to energy production in muscles. In fact, there are reports of some people with carnitine deficiency who have developed myopathy and cardiomyopathy that was completely reversed with carnitine treatment. The main objective of our project is to determine the number of patients who have carnitine deficiency as a cause of their myopathy and cardiomyopathy. The investigators will be measuring carnitine levels in 1000 patients with cardiomyopathy and will describe the specific features in all the study patients to see if there are any trends that may help us predict which patients with muscle weakness are at risk of developing low carnitine levels. The investigators will be treating patients with low carnitine levels with carnitine and observing them to see if their cardiomyopathy and their muscle weakness improve.

       " 'pazopanib_NCRCC,Ph2 STUDY Recent advances in understanding the biology and genetics of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have led to major therapeutic implications. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation, present in the majority of sporadic forms of RCC, leads to a defective VHL protein, followed by an active transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), c-kit, and others. However, the concept of VHL inactivation in RCC and the subsequent malignant phenotype is almost exclusively seen in patients with clear cell histology. The data about efficacy of VEGF receptor inhibitors for non-clear cell RCC (NCRCC) is rare until now. Recently, however, sunitinib and sorafenib showed its worth for NCRCC in extended access programs.1-3 Although it is not certain, the underlying mechanism of their action might lie in that papillary, chromophobe, and sarcomatoid type overexpress c-kit, which is also a target of both drugs and could therefore provide a therapeutic target for non-clear cell subtypes.4-7 Pazopanib is also a potent and selective, orally available, small molecule inhibitor of VEGFR-1,-2, and -3, PDGF-α, PDGF-β, and c-kit tyrosine kinases. It has been validated and licensed for advanced clear cell RCC (CCRCC).8 However, there is very few data about its efficacy for NCRCC.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Patients commonly have chronic diarrhea with abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. Acute disease flares are treated with large doses of corticosteroids, but long-term use of these drugs can have harmful side effects. ECP (described below), is approved to treat skin symptoms associated with a type of cancer called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and has been used experimentally in conditions involving abnormal inflammation. Patients 18 years of age and older who have had Crohn's disease for at least 6 months, who are corticosteroid-dependent, and whose symptoms are controlled well enough so that their Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is less than 220, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and review of medical records, physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood tests, urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, and a questionnaire about how Crohn's disease affects their life and activities. Patients with a CDAI score of less than 150 will begin ECP treatments as soon as possible. Those with scores from 150 to 219 will have their corticosteroid dose increased enough to bring their CDAI score to below 150 before beginning ECP. Patients who do not achieve a CDAI of less than 150 after 4 to 6 weeks of increased corticosteroids will be excluded from the study. Participants will have ECP treatments for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, for a total of 26 treatments. For ECP, patients undergo leukapheresis, a method of collecting large numbers of white blood cells, or leukocytes-cells that may be responsible for many of the medical problems in Crohn's disease. Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating a unit of blood. The blood flows through a machine that separates it into its components by spinning. The white cells are removed and collected in a plastic bag, and the red blood cells and plasma are returned to the patient's bloodstream through the same needle. The collected white cells are mixed with a drug called UVADEX® (Registered Trademark), exposed to ultraviolet (UVA) light, and then returned to the patients' bloodstream. (The UVADEX allows the blood cells to absorb more UVA.) The UVA changes the cells in a way that, once they are back in the body, they cause changes in other cells like them. Each ECP treatment takes 3 to 4 hours. On the first day of each 2-day treatment, patients will undergo a review of symptoms, check of vital signs, and blood draw. They will complete a CDAI diary for 7 days before the first of the two ECP treatments and a questionnaire about their life and activities at 4-week intervals. During the ECP treatment period, corticosteroids will be slowly reduced as long as disease symptoms do not worsen. Patients whose disease remains under control with cessation of all steroids may begin maintenance ECP, 2 days in a row every 4 weeks for an additional 20 weeks (another 10 treatments), with the same follow-up as described above, and a full physical examination 4 weeks after the final treatment. Patients who were able to reduce, but not stop, steroid treatment may be considered for maintenance therapy if it is thought that continuing treatment may enable further reduction of steroids. Patients whose disease symptoms worsen with ECP or who have not been able to decrease their steroid dose will not be eligible for maintenance therapy and their participation in the study will end.\",\n",
       " 'The Effects of Dapagliflozin on HDL Particles Subtypes and Reverse Cholesterol Transport in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In Phase 2b/3 clinical trials, Dapagliflozin has been shown to raise HDL cholesterol levels by about 4 mg/dl (1 mmol/l), which is generally considered a clinically-meaningful change. As this HDL cholesterol increase is carried out with concomitant improvement in glucotoxicity and body weight reduction, it is possible that treatment with Dapagliflozin also improves HDL function. This is important because clinical, epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that HDL function may be more important than HDL cholesterol levels in determining the protective cardiovascular effects of HDL particles. In addition, knowing the effects of Dapagliflozin on HDL function can help interpreting the increase in HDL cholesterol levels observed in Dapagliflozin-treated patients. Finally, discovery of extra-glycemic effects of Dapagliflozin will shed new light on the potential benefits of therapy with Dapagliflozin and SGLT2i in general. So far, no study evaluated the effects of Dapagliflozin (or other SGLT2i) on HDL function. The investigators hypothesize that Dapagliflozin, in addition to raising HDL cholesterol levels, also increases HDL functionality, measured as reverse cholesterol transport and anti-oxidant capacity, in patients with T2DM',\n",

Wegener's granulomatosis can affect many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, eyes, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, joints, heart, and other sites. Standard treatment is a combination of prednisone and a cytotoxic agent (a drug that interferes with cell growth), usually cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. However, many patients treated with this regimen have a disease relapse, and others cannot take these drugs because of severe side effects. This study will focus on the effectiveness of daclizumab in preventing disease relapse. The Food and Drug Administration approved daclizumab in 1997 for preventing kidney transplant rejection, and the drug has also been studied in people with an eye infection called uveitis. The drug works by binding to a protein on T lymphocytes (white blood cells of the immune system) called CD25. This prevents another protein, called interleukin-2, from binding to this site, thereby preventing a series of events that normally results in inflammation. Patients between 10 and 75 years of age with Wegener's granulomatosis may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a medical history review and physical examination, including laboratory studies. If medically indicated, x-rays, consultations and biopsies (surgical removal of a small tissue sample) of affected organs will also be conducted. All patients will begin treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide daily. Those who improve on this regimen will reduce the prednisone gradually and continue with cyclophosphamide until their disease is in remission. While taking cyclophosphamide, patients must have blood and urine tests done every 1 to 2 weeks. Those who achieve disease remission will stop cyclophosphamide and start taking methotrexate once a week, usually by mouth but possibly by injection into the muscle or skin. Blood and urine tests will be conducted once a week for 4 weeks while the dosage is being adjusted and then once a month for the duration of treatment. Patients on methotrexate whose prednisone dose is reduced to 10 to 30 mg every other day will be randomly assigned either to receive or not receive daclizumab in addition to the methotrexate. Daclizumab is given intravenously (through a plastic tube inserted into a vein) the day after the randomization, then again in 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and once a month for 18 months. All patients will continue to taper their prednisone dose until it is stopped. Methotrexate will continue for 2 years. Patients whose disease remains in remission at this time will decrease the methotrexate dose. If there is no active disease when both prednisone and methotrexate have been stopped, no further treatment will be given. If disease recurs at a later time, treatment will be reinstituted. The treatment will be determined by the severity of disease, other medical conditions, and history of side effects. Patients not randomized to daclizumab who relapse while still taking methotrexate may be offered re-treatment with daclizumab. Patients will be evaluated in the outpatient clinic every 4 to 8 weeks until randomization. Patients not taking daclizumab will be followed every 4 to 12 weeks; those taking the drug will be seen every 2 weeks for the first month, every month after that during the 18-month treatment period, and every 4 to 12 weeks until all medications stop. Follow-up evaluations include a physical examination, blood draws and, if medically indicated, X-rays. The total study duration is 60 to 70 months.\",\n",

Many Phases II and III clinical trials of sunitinib in several solid tumors are completed or still ongoing. So far, the efficacy of sunitinb has been confirmed by the phase III trial for imatinib-resistance or intolerance advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients. And sutent was approved to effective by two phase II trials in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients after failure of immunotherapies, and one phase III trial in treatment-naive advanced renal carcinoma patients. Sunitinib (SUTENT ®) has been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma patients and in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients who are intolerant or progressed after imatinib mesylate. European Medicines Agency (EMEA) conditionally granted the marketing approval for the treatment of metastatic renal carcinoma patients after failure of immunotherapy. A phase II trial (A6181040 study) on non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with sunitinib alone showed anti-tumor activity. In 63 enrolled patients treated with 4/2 schedule (4 weeks treatment, then two weeks interruption), 7 patients are confirmed partial response (overall response rate, 11%), and median progress-free time is 14.3 weeks. Presently, a phase III study is underway on non-small cell lung cancer patients followed by and now is under recruiting. Non-small cell lung cancer cells often over-express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. Besides, the expression of the VEGF ligands is also correlated with increased tumor angiogenesis, as well as shortened survival time. One study treated with VEGF-directed monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) and VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) small molecule inhibitors (sunitinib) showed that some non-small cell lung cancer patients are with anti-tumor activity. The chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and platinum-based compounds, were with evidence that they have direct cytotoxicity to cancer cells. Therefore, the investigators are paying attention to the efficacy of combining sunitinib and conventional chemotherapy in this study. The study is designed as first line of salvage therapy on metastatic or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer patients. The main goals of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DR) of sunitinib in combinational with docetaxel and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients.',\n",

The number of cancer-related deaths related to CRC is also rising to an alarming level. This picture is similarly seen in Egypt where the incidence of colorectal carcinoma is increasing annually, moreover, CRC in Egypt exhibits an alarming characteristic which is the affection of much younger patients than their counterparts worldwide. Fortunately, the early detection of CRC and its precursor (adenoma) has been shown to markedly decrease morbidity and mortality related to this tumor, this has prompted the development of robust screening programs for CRC in several western countries. The implementation of a CRC screening program in Egypt has been hampered by the low compliance of the patients and the relatively high cost of colonoscopy. There is a need for an affordable, non-invasive, simple, accurate and socially accepted screening test to allow such a program to succeed in Egypt. Recent studies have shown that DNA is the future target of screening tests for several malignancies. Particularly for CRC a few preliminary studies have shown encouraging results with separate DNA methylation markers both in blood and stool. In our efforts to develop a screening test with the criteria stated above, the investigators have decided to join the forces of 2 of the largest medical centers in Egypt and the middle-east: Kasr-Alaini hospital and the National cancer institute (NCI). The investigators plan to test a panel of 7 DNA methylation markers in peripheral blood for their performance as an early marker for CRC and colorectal adenomas. Data from this study will pave the way for the development of a screening test for CRC \"tailored\" to the Egyptian population, moreover, it will supply essential data about the genetic alterations occurring in CRC in Egyptian patients.',\n",

       " 'Multicenter Validation of the Sensitivity of Theranostic ALK Rearrangement Detection by FISH Analysis and Prevalence of Escaping Mutations in Circulating Tumor Cells for the Non-invasive Management of Lung Cancer Patients Patients eligibility to targeted therapies relies on a molecular test performed on a tumor sample collected by biopsy. This invasive procedure is associated with a relative high risk of morbidity and requires the intervention of a costly and important technical platform. Thus, inoperable patients can be deprived from potentially more efficient therapies. A \"liquid biopsy\" of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) present in the blood and their molecular characterization is an appealing alternative to meet an urgent need for these patients. Moreover no CTC-based molecular test is currently routinely available. The 5-year survival rate of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is low. Recent reports demonstrated that the detection of an ALK rearrangement in the tumor tissue allows patients with late-stages NSCLC to benefit from crizotinib treatment. However, 1) the detection of an ALK rearrangement is currently performed on small biopsies or fine-needle aspirates and can be hindered by the limited tissue quantities available. Tumor tissue is difficult to obtain in patients with advanced/metastatic lung cancer for whom surgery is rarely a component of treatment. Finding alternative and more effective means of diagnosing an ALK rearrangement are critical issues for identifying patients who may benefit from treatment with crizotinib; 2) some patients develop resistance to crizotinib due to de novo ALK mutations. In this setting, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which have been shown to be detectable by ISET (Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumor Cells) method in 80% to 100 % of late stages lung cancer patients represent a non-invasive and easily accessible source of tumor material for assessing ALK rearrangement and escaping mutations in a kinetic manner. The ISET method was first published in 2000 and several independent teams have now established its high sensitivity and specificity of ISET for NSCLC. With ISET, specificity can be achieved using the same methods and criteria used by cytopathologists to diagnose solid tumors. The high sensitivity and specificity of ISET are two essential starting points for the feasibility of this present project. Low-throughput molecular characterization of CTCs isolated by ISET has also been achieved. The remaining challenge consists in developing high-throughput ISET-based molecular tests for personalized medicine that are transferable to the clinics. The Team 1 at the CHU de Nice and the Team 2 at the Gustave Roussy Institute have demonstrated that the detection of an ALK rearrangement in CTC isolated by ISET is feasible and consistent with results obtained in corresponding tumor tissues. In this context, the aim of this project is to obtain 1) a definitive prospective clinical validation of the use of CTC as an alternative to tumor tissue for ALK analysis-based patients stratification; 2) a proof that escaping mutations can be detected early by kinetic analysis of CTC in patients treated by crizotinib. ALK rearrangement will be prospectively investigated in CTCs isolated by ISET at diagnosis and during follow up from patients with stage IIIb/IV lung cancer and de novo mutations will be searched in patients with resistance to crizotinib. This study will provide both clinical and economic benefit to targeted treatment of patients with advanced lung cancer. This project is strongly original as no CTC-based ALK rearrangement test has been independently validated up to now with clinical samples. The development of non-invasive theranostic test through the genetic analysis of CTCs is a clinically relevant goal for non-invasive stratification of cancer patients, avoiding morbidity related to lung biopsy and surgery. It would allow determining patient\\'s eligibility to targeted therapies on a blood sample analysis. CTC-based ALK test could be useful to guide the choice of ALK targeted therapy in patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, developing biomarkers based on CTCs analysis would open the way to the non-invasive follow up of aggressive cancers, early detection of mutations associated with resistance to targeted therapies and tailoring treatment to a real time analysis of the evolving tumor cell populations. This test is expected to markedly improve patients\\' quality of life avoiding invasive diagnostic procedures.',\n",

The aortic dilation and aortic valve degeneration are common complications in patients with BAV. Statins have shown a reduction in the expression of metalloproteinases of the extracellular matrix observed in aortic aneurisms. Several retrospective studies have suggested the benefit of the statins to reduce aortic dilation in patients with BAV. Moreover, although statins did not show to be useful in the progression of aortic stenosis, different studies have suggested a higher profit when the valve affection is not severe. The objective of this study is to determine whether atorvastatin is effective at reducing the progression of aortic dilation in patients with BAV.',\n",

Myotubularin is essential for optimum muscle function. To date, over 100 mutations have been described resulting in a range of disease onset and symptom severity. The early onset form presents with neonatal hypotonia, muscle weakness, respiratory distress and an ongoing requirement for continuous ventilatory support with the inability to maintain a sitting position once placed. Males with both later onset and milder symptoms usually do not require ongoing ventilatory support, achieve a higher maximal motor function with ability to sit when placed and even walk, and have improved survival rates. Males with XLMTM may experience complications (events) at birth and throughout their lifetime. The goal of the study is to identify the number of events over twelve months in males with genetically confirmed XLMTM. Parents or affected individuals over the age of 18 years who are able to access telephone will provide answers to an established event survey to evaluate the frequency and types of events. Emergency department, hospital admissions and mortality will be confirmed by obtaining medical reports. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no association between the frequency of events and markers of clinical severity including the need for ventilatory support at birth, current level of ventilatory support (no support, support less than 12 hours, support more than 12 hours) and current motor function (walking, sitting without support, inability to sit without support).',\n",

To study the mechanisms of carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer will help us understand this disease and develop new strategies of diagnosis and prevention for ovarian cancer in the future. The present diagnostic methods of malignancy are clinical symptoms, physical examination, evaluation of tumor markers and instruments. It is a important issue to diagnose cancer earlier to improve the survival of cancer patients.

Participants take BAY 43-9006 by mouth twice a day, morning and evening. On the first and 15th days of treatment, patients are admitted to the hospital for pharmacokinetic studies; that is, a test of how the body handles the drug. For the test, blood is collected at intervals (at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after ingestion) to determine the drug's level in the bloodstream. Treatment with BAY 43-9006 continues until the study doctor determines that the medication is not beneficial or the patient wishes to withdraw from the study. In addition to drug therapy, patients undergo the following tests and procedures: - Physical examination every 4 weeks - Blood pressure checks once a week during the first 4 weeks - Blood tests every week - CT scans or other imaging tests, such as ultrasound or MRI, every 8 weeks to evaluate the tumor's response to treatment. CT is an x-ray test that provides detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It can be done from different angles, providing a 3-dimensional picture of the part of the body being studied and allowing the doctor to see the location, nature, and extent of disease. MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves instead of x-rays to produce accurate, detailed pictures of organs and tissues. - PET-CT approximately every 8 weeks to look at how different parts of the body take up and use glucose (a sugar nutrient). Because rapidly growing cells, such as tumors, use more sugar than normal cells do, this test can be used to detect cancer. For the test, the patient is given an injection of a sugar solution in which a radioactive tracer has been attached to the sugar molecule. A special camera detects the radiation emitted by the solution, and the resulting images show how much sugar is being used in various parts of the body. PET-CT uses the PET scan in combination with standard CT in a machine that does both tests. - DCE-MRI after 2 weeks of treatment. This test uses MRI with a special non-radioactive dye to examine blood flow in a certain part of the body. - Tumor biopsy (optional) after 2 weeks of treatment. A biopsy is the surgical removal of a small piece of tissue. The tumor biopsy is done either using a small bore needle under CT guidance or by direct visualization using a laparoscope/thoracoscope. For the needle biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin and guided by CT into the tumor mass. For the laparoscopy/thoracoscopy, the patient is sedated or asleep and small lighted tubes are inserted into small holes made in the skin. The tumor is located and tissue withdrawn.\",\n",

       " 'An Open Label Dose Escalation Safety Study of Convection-Enhanced Delivery of IL13-PE38QQR in Patients With Progressive Pediatric Diffuse Infiltrating Brainstem Glioma and Supratentorial High-grade Glioma Background: - Diffusely infiltrating pontine glioma (DIPG) or supratentorial high-grade glioma (HGG) are brain tumors that are often difficult to treat. It is very difficult to get chemotherapy agents to tumors in the brain, and researchers are looking for new methods to directly treat these types of cancer. - IL-13 is an immune molecule normally occurring in the body. Patients with gliomas appear to have significant amounts of the IL-13 receptors in their brain tumors. An experimental drug, IL13-PE38QQR, combines a bacteria toxin with human IL-13 to allow the toxin to enter and destroy the tumor cell. Early clinical studies suggest this treatment may prolong survival of patients with these types of brain tumors. - A technique called convection-enhanced delivery (CED) uses continuous pressure to push large molecules through the membranes protecting the brain to reach brain tumors. This technique can treat a tumor more directly than with traditional methods. Objectives: - To test the safety and feasibility of giving IL13-PE38QQR directly into regions of the brain in pediatric patients with DIPG or HGG, using CED. - To determine the most appropriate dose of IL13-PE38QQR to treat DIPG or HGG. - To determine the effects of this experimental therapy on the tumor. - To evaluate the physical changes in the tumor before and after the therapy. Eligibility: - Patients who are less than 18 years of age and have been diagnosed with either DIPG or with supratentorial HGG that has not responded well to standard treatments. Design: - Patients will be admitted to the hospital and will receive a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to show the exact location of the tumor.

For this purpose, the sample size will consist of 37 individuals healthy and 32 without type 2 diabetes mellitus wore a CGMS during 3 days. Participants randomly performed aerobic and eccentric sessions, both in the morning (24h after CGMS placement), and at least 7 days apart. Glucose variability was evaluated by glucose standard deviation, glucose variance, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), and glucose coefficient of variation (conventional methods) as well as by spectral and symbolic analysis (non-conventional methods). Physiological mechanisms altered by exercise protocols (Human Soluble Interleukin-6 and Glutathione), will be measured in blood samples.',\n",
       " 'A Study of LDK378 in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring ROS1 Rearrangement Lung cancer is the most leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Most of the patients with lung cancer are advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. The two oncogenes that are important in lung cancer are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-ras, mutated in 10% and 15% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Large-scale DNA sequencing efforts have identified mutations in BRAF, PI3KCA and ERBB2 that together represent another 5% of NSCLC patients. The success of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib or erlotinib, and more recently ALK/MET TKI, crizotinib, highlights the need to develop more genetically matched therapies. Therefore, genetic classification of lung cancer has become increasingly important along with the advances with targeted therapies. ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase with constitutive kinase activity. ROS1 was previously discovered in cell lines where ROS1 fused with other proteins to act as a driver oncogene. In 2007, Rikova et al reported ROS1 fusion as driver mutations in NSCLC cell line (HCC78; SLC34A2-ROS1) and NSCLC patient (CD74-ROS1). Li et al also found about 1% of samples harboring CD74-ROS1 fusion in 202 resected lung adenocarcinomas from never smokers. The incidence was as high as 10% in East Asian population. Currently there are now at least 13 ROS1 fusion variants involving 8 fusion partners (CD74-, SLC34A2-, FIG-, TPM3-, SDC4-, LRIG3-, ERZ-, KDERL2-) identified in ROS1 positive NSCLC. Interestingly, preclinical and clinical data have shown ROS1-positive tumors are sensitive to crizotinib, because of potentially high common amino acid residues in the kinase domain between ALK and ROS1, which explain why crizotinib can inhibit both ROS1 and ALK to similar extent. Preliminary report from a phase I clinical trial of crizotinib in the ROS1-positive NSCLC expansion cohort showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 57%. Given that crizotinib has made remarkable clinical outcomes in phase I trial of ALK-positive NSCLC patients, clinical development of ROS1 inhibitors, including crizotinib, should be accelerated to provide targeted therapies to ROS1-positive NSCLC patients.',\n",

Recently, there are more treatment methods available which result in increased patient survival. Although adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were both categorized as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the recent advancement of target therapy implied that these two histologies behave differently (Shah NT, et al. 2005; Sandler A, et al. 2006). Radiation therapy is an important method for locally advanced non-resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Computed tomography (CT) is the mainstay for evaluating lung cancer. The advance of multi-row detector CT (MDCT) provides volumetric acquisition within a breath hold, and enables detailed evaluation of tissue and organ perfusion with excellent resolution. Using this new technique with image post processing, excellent spatial resolution and functional perfusion information can be obtained simultaneously. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore not only the longitudinal change of lung cancer eligible for radiation therapy (including concurrent, sequential chemoradiotherapy and high-dose radiation therapy) but also comparison of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancers using perfusion MDCT. Total twenty patients with histopathologically proved adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma will be enrolled in this study and receive longitudinal study for perfusion MDCT evaluation before, during radiation therapy and in early and late phases after complete radiation therapy. Dynamic perfusion will be used for processing the image data, and quantitative parameters such as tumor blood volume and permeability etc will be derived. From this study, we expect to understand the change of tumor vascularity after radiation therapy and characters of treatment response of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in addition to the change of tumor size.',\n",
       " 'Comparative Effectiveness of HIPEC Following Interval Debulking Surgery in Patients With Advanced-stage Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is a lethal malignancy and reported as a fifth leading cause of death in all age in the developed country. Most of the ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages due to an inadequate screening tool and a lack of clinical symptoms. Optimal cytoreductive surgery with no gross residual disease followed platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy has been the most effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. However, the optimal surgical procedure is not always possible, especially in patients with extensive disease or women with poor performance status. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC) followed interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative therapeutic option for these patients. There is growing interest in the use of HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) for ovarian cancer, and early data on HIPEC as a component of front-line therapy of advanced ovarian cancer are encouraging. However, intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not actively used in the treatment of ovarian cancer due to the catheter-related complications or inconvenience. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HIPEC after interval debulking surgery in advanced ovarian cancer patients.',\n",

Full gene sequences of c-KIT、PDGFRA and DOG1, which is extracted from the specimen cells of repeated surgical resection or biopsy tissue in GIST patients with postoperative recurrence, are analyzed with the screening-sequencing approach, in order to investigate the characteristics and variations associated with the different gene mutations of c-KIT、PDGFRA and DOG1 in GIST patients and be likely to find out the evolutionary pattern, try to learn the facts about the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the GIST related genes, make a survey of any association of c-KIT、PDGFRA and DOG1 gene mutations and provide the basis for seeking molecular marker of GIST for monitoring course of disease, and offer a theoretical basis and new therapeutic strategies for application of clinical treatment.',\n",

The study will administer gradually increasing doses of the drug in successive small groups of subjects to determine the optimal dose that is safe and well tolerated. It will be studied first at a single dose and then in multiple doses. The study will also determine how long peramivir stays in the body and how high the drug levels are in the blood. Men and women 18 - 40 years of age who weigh at least 110 lbs. and have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 32 may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), and blood and urine tests. Part I - Single Dose Escalation Participants are admitted to the NIH hospital for 32 to 40 hours for a single 15-minute intravenous infusion of peramivir or placebo (saline), followed by monitoring and evaluation. The drug dose is increased in successive groups of eight subjects; in each group, six subjects are given peramivir and two receive placebo. The first group receives 0.5 mg/kg of peramivir; subsequent groups receive increasingly higher doses (1, 2, 3.5, and 5 mg/kg) as long as the last dose was well tolerated by the preceding group. Blood samples are drawn and subjects are monitored for vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and heart rate) and for symptoms such as headache, nausea, shortness of breath or pain at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours after the drug infusion. At the 24-hour evaluation they have an EKG. If needed, an echocardiogram (ultrasound examination of the heart) may also be done. Subjects return to the clinic 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after the infusion for a check of vital signs, review of symptoms, blood draw, and urine sample collection. In addition, subjects are asked to collect all their urine for the first 48 hours after the study drug infusion. Part II - Multi-dose Escalation Groups of 16 subjects receive an intravenous infusion of peramivir (12 subject) or placebo (4 subjects) once a day for 5 consecutive days. The first four infusions are given in the NIH outpatient clinic. The dose of peramivir is increased in successive groups of 16 subjects as long as the preceding dose was well tolerated. Before the infusion on day 1, subjects have a physical examination, blood test and EKG to obtain baseline values. After the infusion, they remain in the hospital for 6 hours.

       " 'Ramucirumab/Paclitaxel as Second-line Treatment in Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma With Integrative Genomic Analysis Vascular endothelial growth factor is expressed in gastric cancer, and expression has been associated with more aggressive clinical disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor expression has been noted in 51% of gastric cancer specimens in one series (versus no expression in normal epithelium or superficial gastritis). Vascular endothelial growth factor expression in resected gastric cancer is associated with tumor recurrence and shorter survival. Maeda et al. studied 95 gastric cancer patients following resection with curative intent, and noted a significantly shorter survival in 34 patients whose tumor endothelium expressed VEGF (as detected via immunohistochemistry) versus 61 patients without endothelial VEGF expression (p<0.05). Yoshikawa and colleagues observed similar survival differences in resected gastric cancer patients based on levels of circulating (plasma) VEGF at time of resection. Circulating VEGF is significantly higher in gastric cancer patients versus those without neoplasia. Elevated circulating VEGF was also associated with shorter survival in a European cohort undergoing gastric cancer resection; there was no survival beyond 30 months in 24 patients with serum VEGF >533 pg/mL versus a 30-month survival rate >35% for 34 patients with VEGF levels below this threshold (p<0.0001, log-rank test). Recently, Jüttner and colleagues noted reduced survival following R0 resection in gastric cancer patients whose tumors expressed VEGF-C or VEGF-D, with the most robust association between expression and reduced survival for patients whose tumors expressed both VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Investigational inhibition of VEGF Receptor 2 in gastric cancer xenografts (TMK-1 cell line) is associated with reduced tumor growth. DC101 therapy in this model is associated with significant reductions in tumor vascularity (as measured by CD-31 expression) and increases in endothelial and tumor apoptosis. The results of the REGARD and RAINBOW studies are consistent with the idea that tumor- related angiogenesis contributes to the pathophysiology of gastric cancer and demonstrate the ability of ramucirumab to represent an improvement in the care of patients with gastric cancer whose disease has progressed after prior chemotherapy.',\n",

GVHD is a common, serious, and too often fatal, complication after matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation, regardless of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen used (full or reduced intensity). Reduced intensity transplants which employ lower doses of chemotherapy during the conditioning phase of the transplant, are less toxic than full intensity transplants. Reduced intensity transplants may extend the unrelated donor transplant option to older patients or to patients with existing medical conditions or illness, where a full intensity transplant is not possible. To be successful, reduced intensity transplants need to offset any lower effectiveness in killing cancer cells during the conditioning phase, with the establishment of a donor cell, graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). The GVL effect and GVHD are associated with each other and therefore, the goal of GVHD prophylaxis for this study is not so much to prevent all GVHD, but rather to prevent serious and fatal acute GVHD. Most GVHD-related deaths are either the direct consequence of severe GVHD or from infections associated with intense immunosuppression, a consequence of the standard treatments for acute GVHD, which almost always include high-dose steroids. A more effective prophylaxis therapy that allows for the GVL effect to develop, while limiting the exposure to high-dose steroids may reduce transplant mortality and morbidity. We also will study how key chemical and cellular factors relate to clinical outcome.',\n",

To be successful, reduced intensity transplants need to offset any lower effectiveness in killing cancer cells during the conditioning phase, with the establishment of a donor cell, graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). The GVL effect and GVHD are associated with each other and therefore, the goal of GVHD prophylaxis for this study is not so much to prevent all GVHD, but rather to prevent serious and fatal acute GVHD. Most GVHD-related deaths are either the direct consequence of severe GVHD or from infections associated with intense immunosuppression, a consequence of the standard treatments for acute GVHD, which almost always include high-dose steroids. A more effective prophylaxis therapy that allows for the GVL effect to develop, while limiting the exposure to high-dose steroids may reduce transplant mortality and morbidity. We also will study how key chemical and cellular factors relate to clinical outcome.',\n",
       " 'FLOX + Cetuximab (Erbitux®) for Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer and Wild Type K-RAS Tumor The Nordic FLOX-regime consists of a combination of bolus 5-FU, leukovorin and oxaliplatin (Eloxatin®). Cetuximab (Erbitux®) is an antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The combination of FLOX and weekly Erbitux has been investigated in the Nordic VII study where 571 patients were randomized to FLOX (regime A) or FLOX + Erbitux (regime B or C). Effect-data has not yet been published but the combination is well tolerated, and other studies have shown that Erbitux administered with chemotherapy seem to be more efficient than chemotherapy alone. The main purpose with this study is to investigate the effect of FLOX and Erbitux given every second week as first line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and K-RAS wildtype tumor. The latest accessible data regarding treatment towards EGFR and K-RAS mutations shows that patients with K-RAS wildtype responds better to treatment than patients with K-RAS mutations.',\n",

       " 'Estrogen Priming to Increase the Efficacy of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Operable Breast Cancer One of the basic principles of cancer chemotherapy is that these drugs act exclusively or mainly on cells in cycle. Estrogens have been shown to increase the fraction of breast cancer cells in cycle. Tamoxifen on the other hand, decreases the proliferative fraction and has been shown to negatively impact on the results of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer when given concomitantly. A number of previous studies have attempted estrogenic recruitment of cancer cells (into cell cycle) to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Although some studies showed an increase in response rates in the recruitment arm, there was no benefit in time to progression or survival in any of the studies. These results may have been due to the inadequate sample size of the studies and advanced stage disease (with presumably higher fraction of inherently chemoresistant cells). The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that estrogenic recruitment of micrometastatic disease in operable breast cancer will increase the efficacy of standard adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. The intervention arm of the study will involve administration of short duration estrogen prior to each cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. The end-points are disease free and overall survival.',\n",

       " 'Novel Intervention to Influence Muscle Plasticity in Veterans The loss of muscle contraction (paralysis) removes an important stimulus for maintenance of overall health for individuals with complete spinal cord injury (SCI). Increased protein catabolism (atrophy) limits important stresses to the skeletal system. Bone loss doubles the risk of fracture and contributes to increased mortality in Veterans with SCI. Metabolic syndrome and diabetes lead to heart disease in Veterans with SCI at higher rates than the general population. Exercise methods to sustain muscle tissue, bone density, and metabolic stability after SCI are lacking scientific justification. If left unchecked, the secondary complications of SCI can be health limiting or even life threatening to Veterans with paralysis. The importance of maintaining the health of the musculoskeletal system after SCI has never been greater as a cure for paralysis may become a reality. Contemporary rehabilitation interventions lack the ability to functionally load muscle tissue, quantify the dose of load, stress the cardiovascular system, monitor the overall stresses during daily exercise training, or offer portability to improve compliance with the exercise. The long-term goal of this project is to establish the optimal dose of muscle and bone stress during functional exercise in order to improve the health of Veterans with complete paralysis. The practical outcome of this research is to offer a form of activity that is feasible, portable, and grounded in sound scientific principles. The scientific goal is to understand whether the dose of force generated in paralyzed muscle via evoked contractions is critical to muscle atrophy/hypertrophy molecular pathways, physiologic performance, and insulin sensitivity. The investigators will administer various doses of muscle force by manipulating the frequency of electrical stimulation while keeping stimulation current (i.e. muscle fiber recruitment) constant. Interestingly, no previous study has examined the dose of muscle force necessary to trigger adaptations in protein synthesis/degradation pathways. The investigators wish to discover the most effective method to maintain the molecular and physiologic properties of paralyzed muscle. The investigators believe such a method will be in urgent demand as a co-intervention with pharmaceutical strategies in post-SCI rehabilitation.',\n",

In MIRACL study , atorvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in 3,086 patients (atorvastatin n = 1.538, placebo n = 1.548), acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction without Q-wave or unstable angina). Treatment was initiated during the acute phase after hospital admission and lasted for a period of 16 weeks. Treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg / day increased the latency of the combined primary endpoint, defined as death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia requiring admission to hospital, indicating a risk reduction of 16% (p = 0,048). This was mainly due to a 26% reduction in re-hospitalization for angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia. The other secondary endpoints were not statistically significant by themselves (total: placebo: 22.2%, Atorvastatin: 22.4%). Statins by reducing coronary syndromes, it appears that contribute to reducing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is exactly what was observed in 4S, in which the incidence of chronic heart failure (CHF) during follow-up was 10.3% for those who received placebo and 8.3% in the simvastatin group, a finding which translates 19% reduction in heart failure (P <0,015) nationwide with the appearance episode (event) CV.',\n",

       " 'Haemodynamic Response to Aortic Surgery Open elective abdominal aortic surgery is a high risk procedure involving clamping of the aorta. Indications include abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or aortic occlusive disease (AOD) causing lower limb ischaemia. These patients are often regarded as one entity in postoperative study settings. However, previous studies indicate that risk profiles, inflammatory activity, and haemodynamic capacity may differ between these groups. The first aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative ICU-requirements after open elective abdominal aortic surgery, hypothesising that AAA-patients had longer ICU-stays and needed more mechanical ventilation or acute dialysis than did patients with AOD. The investigators see a relatively high incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) following aortic surgery. Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalcin (NGAL) may be useful in the early diagnosis of postopeative AKI. However, NGAL is also known as a marker of inflammatory activation. The ischaemia-reperfusion injury and subsequent inflammatory response to aortic cross clamping may per se induce a rise in NGAL despite intact renal function. Therefore NGAL may not be a reliable marker of AKI after AAS. The second aim of this study is to describe the changes in NGAL after AAS in patients with and without postoperative dialysis-dependent AKI.',\n",

       " 'Phase II Study of Afatinib as Third- or Further-line Treatment for Patients With Stage IV Bronchial Adenocarcinoma, Harboring Wild-type EGFR, Expressing the Neurotensin - Neurotensin Receptor Complex Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in France, Europe and the world. 50% of lung cancers are of the adenocarcinoma subtype. 60% of patients present with a metastatic disease (stage IV) at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 10% of patients present with a mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) requiring an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), namely erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib. For the majority of chemotherapy-naïve patients without addictive mutation, platinum-based chemotherapy, frequently the platinum - pemetrexed doublet, provides disease control rate of up to 70% and improves survival from approximately 4.5 with best supportive care alone to 15 months. However, patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) usually relapse within 4 to 6 months and benefit from a second-line chemotherapy. Authorized drugs in this setting are pemetrexed, docetaxel and erlotinib. The prescription of erlotinib for unselected patients whose tumor does not harbor an EGFR mutation is questionable . In the second line setting, docetaxel provides less than 10% of partial responses and progression-free survival of 10 to 12 weeks. There are no standard options following failure of two previous lines of standard chemotherapy. In view of these modest results, new agents and therapeutic strategies are greatly needed for this patient population. Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13 amino acids peptide, present and biologically active in the central nervous system and in periphery. At the peripheral level, NTS is released by the endocrine cells of the intestinal mucosa after meals and acts as an endocrine hormone involved in the postprandial regulation of the motor functions of the gastrointestinal tract. The effects of NTS are mediated by three subtypes of receptor: NTSR1 and NTSR2 exhibit high and low affinity for NTS, respectively, and belong to the family of G protein receptors; NTSR3 is a single transmembrane domain receptor. Exogenous activation of NTSR1 leads to cell proliferation, survival, mobility and invasion in cancer cells from diverse origin. These effects are the result from the activation of kinases and effectors, such as PKC, MAPK, FAK, RHO-GTPase, RAS and Src. The PKC activation may induce MAPK by direct stimulation of Raf-1, or by transactivation of the EGFR. The activation of MAPK via NTSR1 is mainly associated with uncontrolled cell growth. Both NTS and NTSR1 are expressed in 40% of lung tumors, whereas they are never expressed in the normal tissue. NTSR1 high expression is a negative prognostic factor in stage I to III operated lung adenocarcinomas. Sustained stimulation of NTSR1 results in the activation of MMP1, the release of EGF \"like\" ligands such as HB-EGF as well as neuregulin 1 NGR1 (a specific ligand for HER3) followed by EGFR, HER2 and HER3 overexpression and activation. Accordingly, xenografted tumors expressing NTS and NTSR1 show a positive response to erlotinib, whereas tumors void of NTSR1 expression have no detectable response. Afatinib (BIBW2992) is a small molecule, selective and irreversible erbB family blocker. In preclinical models it effectively inhibits EGFR, HER2 and HER4 phosphorylation resulting in tumour growth inhibition and regression of established subcutaneous tumours derived from four human cell-lines known to co-express ErbB receptors. Our claim is that patients harbouring the NTS/NTSR complex, without EGFR mutation, will respond to afatinib due to the sustained activation of EGFR/HER2 under neurotensin activation. Presently, only EGFR mutated tumors are eligible to receive EGFR TKI representing 10% of all lung cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib, an EGFR TKI, on lung adenocarcinomas, EGFR wild-type, bearing the NTS/NTSR1 complex with a high level of expression. This subpopulation of patients represents approximately 20% of lung adenocarcinomas.',\n",

Each patient enrolled will receive the matching targeted therapy during 12 weeks (MTT) or 24 weeks (IT). At the end of this induction period: - patients with a tumor response will continue the targeted therapy, - patients in progression will discontinue the targeted therapy and will be withdrawn from study and oriented towards standard treatments - patients with a stable disease at 12 weeks (MTT) or 24 weeks (IT) will be randomized in order to determine if they continue or stop the therapy. About 80 patients will be treated in each of the 5 MTT treatment groups opened to enrollment and 125 patients will be treated in IT treatment groups , each group corresponding to an available targeted therapy.',\n",

However, the presence of EGFR mutations can only imperfectly predict outcome. The investigators hypothesize that progression-free survival could be influenced both by the pretreatment EGFR T790M mutation and by components of DNA repair pathways.

The epidemic in Indonesia has been fueled by injection drug use among heroin users and the national response includes the scale-up of methadone maintenance treatment. Drug counseling is considered to be an integral part of methadone treatment, but few studies have been designed to assess its benefits and costs. In settings such as Jakarta, data regarding the costs and benefits of drug counseling have critical public heath relevance. The investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of integrated drug and HIV counseling among injecting drug users. This study will be conducted at six methadone clinics in Jakarta, Indonesia where the HIV prevalence among injecting drug users ranges between 50- 86%, with collaborators from the Drug Dependence Hospital in Jakarta, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The specific aims of this four year study are to evaluate the impact of Behavioral Drug and Risk Counseling (BDRC)—a low intensity, cognitive behavioral approach that integrates drug counseling and risk reduction intervention. Those assigned to the BDRC arm will be compared to those who receive treatment as usual which includes an initial risk reduction intervention and counseling as needed. The investigators hypothesize that the structured, low intensity BDRC approach will be more cost effective and result in higher rates of retention in treatment, lower rates of drug use and lower rates of HIV risk. To test these hypotheses, the research team in Jakarta will recruit 300 injecting drug users as they enter treatment at the Drug Dependence Hospital and its five satellite programs. Following informed consent procedures, research staff will randomize participants to either the BDRC intervention or to treatment as usual. All subjects will be fuly assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, and 12.

       " 'Simvastatin Therapy in Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common childhood cardiomyopathy and is associated with significant early morbidity and mortality. About half of patients die or require heart transplantation within 5 years of diagnosis. The medical therapy for DCM with heart failure includes anti-congestive medications and antiplatelet therapy. Those who fail to improve within the first year of diagnosis usually deteriorated even upon aggressive anti-congestive medications. The investigators had conducted precision-medicine-based approach to provide strategic approach as drug repurposing to identify new treatments. The investigators have identified the beneficial effects from a statin, simvastatin, to restore the cardiac contractility. The investigators would further assess the efficacy of simvastatin to improve the cardiac function in patients with DCM.',\n",
       " 'Comparison of Beta-blocker Versus Angiotensin Receptor Blocker for Suppression of Aneurysm Expansion in Patients With Small Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm and Hypertension (BASE Trial) Various medical therapies have been proposed to prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion. However, there have been very few randomized clinical trials to support use of any of these treatments. Several animal studies and observational reports suggest that ARBs can be useful in reducing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth. However, so far, ARBs have not been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of valsartan, an ARB, on annual growth rate in comparison with atenolol, a beta-blocker. Our hypothesis is that valsartan is superior to atenolol in the suppression of the aneurysm growth at 12 months. The BASE trial is designed as a investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized controlled open-label trial. Patients with small AAA (aorta diameter <5cm) will be randomized 1:1 either to valsartan or to atenolol group. Randomization will be stratified by the AAA size (max. diameter >4 cm or ≤4 cm). Patients will receive either valsartan (daily dose 80 mg or more) or atenolol (daily dose 50 mg or more) for 12 months. A CT scan will measure the maximal diameter of AAA at baseline and 12 months. The annual growth of AAA will be compared between the valsartan and the atenolol group.',\n",

       " \"Mitochondrial Activity and Myosteatosis in the Cachexia of Cancers of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract Loss of muscle mass (scientific term: cachexia) affects about 80% of patients with advanced cancer and impacts their prognosis by decreasing tolerance and response to treatment, decreasing quality of life and survival. The prognosis in these patients depends directly on the importance of the loss of muscle mass. Preserving it is therefore an essential therapeutic objective. It is therefore important to understand perfectly the mechanism of this muscular loss. The accumulation of fat in the muscle (scientific term: myosteatosis) could be a mechanism responsible for this loss of muscle mass. It is indeed a hypothesis proved on animal models. Moreover, it has recently been shown that more the cancer patient loses weight, more his muscle contains fat. This lets think that this deposit of fat in the muscle would be directly related to the loss of muscle mass. All of these observations could not be clearly established in humans and investigators are seeking by this study to illuminate these mechanisms at the human level. A better understanding of these mechanisms would allow investigator to set up targeted treatments against the accumulation of fat in the muscle, which would significantly improve the quality of life of patients with cancer of the aerodigestive pathways and their chances of recovery. The MYOMEC study includes the inclusion of healthy patients (to form a control group) but also patients with cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract. The study will be divided into two parts: clinical examination and nutritional evaluation the day before surgery at the time of the participants' admission to hospital and then the biological samples during surgery. The nutritional examination consists in collecting the morphological data of the patient, namely: Its weight, size, calculation of the body mass index Tests of muscular strength (wearing weight of 1, 2 and 3 kilos) Measurement of the percentage of fat mass and lean mass (Impedancemetry) In this study, participants benefit from the following investigations: - Clinical examination complete with elaboration of the clinical nutritional status, realized the day before the surgical intervention in hospitalization. - Elaboration of the radiological nutritional status by a complementary analysis of the scanner envisaged in the balance of extension of the disease - Performing surgical site sampling during surgery without additional invasive procedure and under general anesthesia. It will be realized: A muscle biopsy of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle (neck muscle) (maximum volume 5 mm3), A tumor biopsy (maximum volume 5mm3). A blood sample (maximum volume 5ml) No invasive procedure, supplemental examination or additional consultation is required for the whole off-set study for the extensive muscular percutaneous biopsy regarding which additional patient agreement will be required. No additional follow-up is required when participating in this study. Participation in this study does not entail any particular constraint or additional treatment. The duration of the patient's participation is defined as follows: from the date of the preoperative consultation or from the consultation of announcement until his / her discharge from hospital. The exclusion period defined in this study extends from the date of inclusion of the patient to the date of the surgical procedure, during which time the patient can not participate in another clinical research protocol.\",\n",

At the start of the trial (stage 1), participants will be randomized with a ratio 2:2:1 to one of three treatment arms: Arm A: trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) per intravenous injection (IV) every 3 weeks; Arm B: trastuzumab emtansine 2.4 mg/kg IV every week; Arm C: standard taxane therapy (docetaxel 75 milligram per meter square [mg/m^2] IV every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 kg IV every week per investigator choice). At the end of the first stage of the study, the dose and schedule of trastuzumab emtansine that will be used in the second stage of the study will be selected by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The regimen selection analysis will be made after approximately 100 participants across all three study arms have been treated for at least 12 weeks. Once a trastuzumab emtansine regimen has been selected, Stage I participants who were assigned to the treatment arm which was selected for Stage II of the study and participants who were in the standard taxane group will continue to receive their assigned treatment regimen. Stage I participants who were assigned to the regimen that was not selected for further evaluation will continue to receive their assigned regimen and will continue to be followed for efficacy and safety. In Stage II of the study, additional participants will be recruited and randomized with a ratio 2:1 to either the selected regimen of trastuzumab emtansine or to the standard taxane therapy. Participants will receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, initiation of another cancer therapy or withdrawal.',\n",

The study will be conducted in 2 stages. Approximately 95 patients (15 at Stage 1/ 80 at Stage 2) will be accrued to this study to receive treatment. Stage 2 of the trial will only be conducted if at least 5 out of 15 patients at Stage 1 show at least partial response according to an objective criteria to evaluate tumor size based on contrast enhancement [modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST)] assessed by external independent radiologists. Refametenib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) protein kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. By specifically targeting these proteins, refametinib in combination with sorafenib may stop cancer growth. The growth of the tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific proteins from functioning. The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on the rate of response, i.e. the disease getting smaller. The aim is to show that the therapy with refametinib in combination with sorafenib improves the response rate in this patient population compared to historical results observed with the sorafenib only.',\n",

       " 'Temporal Genomics Mechanisms Underlying Disease and Aging Given the salient role of early-life adversity and the resulting biological embedding in disease risk, there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms operating at multiple levels of analysis in order to promote effective clinical treatments and intervention efforts for survivors. An example for such an effort could be to utilize models of dynamic cellular markers as individual-level factors to account for variation in intervention response and clinical outcomes. Results of this study will lead to new knowledge about specific gene expression pathways in response to stress, and whether the response is moderated by previous exposure to early adversity, shorter telomere length (a marker of cellular aging) and self-report mental-health measures. Thus, the long-term effects of this study will advance our understanding on stress-related transcriptomic changes that play a downstream role in disease susceptibility and accelerated aging, with the goal of targeting specific pathways and genes for potential intervention studies and pharmacological treatments to reverse the effects of exposure to early adversity. For example, considering high failure rates for depression treatments, and in order to tailor individual interventions, identifying objective changes in stress-induced gene expression may help to predict intervention efficacy in clinical and non-clinical settings, as seen, for example, in breast and leukemia cancers. Thus, findings will have a range of impacts for basic science, intervention studies and clinical practice that will influence treatments to match the specific cellular processes operating within an individual.',\n",

People who have tumors that can be removed by surgery live longer than those whose cancer cannot be removed. Chemotherapy can shrink some tumors in the liver, which also helps people to live longer, and sometimes chemotherapy can shrink tumors enough that they can be removed by surgery. However, most chemotherapy drugs do not work well on tumors in the liver. In this study we are testing a new drug, TKM-080301, given directly into the cancer blood supply in the liver circulation, to see if it will cause tumors to shrink. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of TKM-080301 for cancer in the liver that has not responded to standard treatments. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have inoperable cancer that has started in or spread to the liver. Design: - Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood tests, and imaging studies. - Participants will have a liver angiogram (type of X-ray study) to look at the blood flow in the liver and to place a catheter for delivery of the TKM080301. - Participants will have a single dose of TKM-080301 given directly into the liver.

Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center on two occasions: once while they are regularly taking their levothyroxine, and once while they are off the medication in preparation for their radioactive iodide diagnostic scan for the procedures outlined below. The time interval between the two clinic visits depends on whether the first visit is while the patient is on or off medication. Participants are asked to fast overnight before each visit and to abstain from certain foods and beverages for 48 to 72 hours before the visit. At each visit, patients undergo the following procedures: - Medication history, limited physical examination, and blood draw for laboratory tests, including a test to look for genes important in eliminating medications from the body. - Insertion of a catheter (thin plastic tube) into an arm vein for collecting blood samples. - Shave skin biopsy (optional) to explore how proteins in the skin that metabolize and transport drugs are affected by thyroid hormone. For this procedure, the skin is cleaned, numbed with medicine, and a small sample of the top layer is removed with a razor blade. The wound heals in 2 to 3 days. - Medication dosing.

RT is known to produce a wide range of oral side effects such as hypo-salivation, caries, xerostomia, mucositis and osteoradionecrosis. Hypo-salivation may lead to a shift in diversity of the bacterial population altering oral homeostasis. RT may also cause a variation in saliva protein composition which can affect its rheological properties and host defence increasing the possibility of caries development. Additionally, the effects of RT on the organic and inorganic structure/ composition of teeth and the possible relation with caries risk have not been investigated so far. Mucositis is another frequent oral complication of RT and it is estimated that more than 80% of the treated patients will develop this condition. Longitudinal studies assessing all these conditions before and after cancer treatment have not been reported in literature to date. Therefore, the main objective of the proposed study is to assess the chemical composition of the dentine matrix, the variations in salivary proteins and in oral microbiome occurring in Head & Neck cancer patients undergoing RT. These data will be collected and a complete oral assessment with 18 month follow up will be performed. All these data will be computed to demonstrate the associations between RT and caries risk to demonstrate possible mechanistic causes.',\n",

       " 'Analysis of the Role of Hepatocyte SLAMF3 Receptor and Drug Resistance Proteins (MDR) in Resistance to Treatment With Sorafenib in CHC Patients Primary liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 7th most common cancer in humans; 9th in women (figures from the Association for Research against Cancer ARC). This cancer is a major public health problem on a global scale. Patients, whose diagnosis is often late, are at advanced stages of the pathology, even those who benefit from locoregional treatments have a poor prognosis and suffer from a lack of curative therapeutic strategies. CHC is highly refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy and so far the response rates to conventional systemic chemotherapy has provided a clinical benefit where survival was prolonged by more than 25% in patients with advanced CHC. Further efforts are needed to effectively manage HCC. Knowledge of the mechanisms regulating proliferation and inhibiting the sensitivity of transformed cells to apoptosis is the key to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. Several new therapies, called targeted therapies, are tested in clinical trials. Currently, the most effective molecular agent for targeting the Raf pathway is sorafenib capable of also inhibiting tyrosine kinases of VEGFR and PDGFR. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, decreases the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro that inhibit the activity of targets present in tumor cells (CRAF, BRAF, V600E BRAF, c-KIT, and FLT-3) and tumor vascularization VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-beta). Despite the real benefit of this treatment, its efficacy (three months of overall survival) and its indication remain limited to Child-Pugh A, WHO 0-2 patients in whom curative treatment is contraindicated. In addition, several patients have resistance to Sorafenib and thus find themselves in therapeutic failure, thus limiting the therapeutic choice for these patients. Resistance to treatment with Sorafenib limits the therapeutic choice. The mechanisms responsible for this resistance remain to be elucidated. Drug resistance proteins, MDR Multi-Drug Resistance, is a family of molecules whose expression increases in the cancer cell and ensures the repression of chemotherapy molecules outside the target cancer cell. This family includes the proteins ABCG2, MDR and MRP1. Our in vitro studies show that treatment of CHC Huh-7 cells with Sorafenib (10 mM) induces the specific expression of the transcripts of the MRP-1 protein without any effect on the expression of the ABCG2 and MDR protein. In addition, sorafenib has an effect on the expression of hepatocyte SLAMF3 receptor transcripts, a receptor recently identified in hepatocyte tissue. Indeed, it has been shown that the expression of SLAMF3 is lowered in the cancerous tissue compared to the healthy tissue and that the reintroduction of a strong expression in the cancer cell inhibits its proliferation by inhibiting the MAPK Erk pathway, Cancer cells to apoptosis and inhibits the uptake of tumor masses in the Nude mouse (I. Marcq, et al., 2013).',\n",
